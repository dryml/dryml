# Contribution Guide

DRYML project accepts contributions via git pull requests.
This document outlines some of the conventions on submission workflow, commit message formatting, contact points, and other resources to make it easier to get your contribution done and accepted.



## How to Contribute

Pull Requests are the main way to contribute.
All the PRs have to pass the personal evaluation of the Project Administrator.

### Format of the Commit Message

The commit summary must start with "Added"/"Updated"/"Removed" and end with a dot.



## Contributor License Agreement

By contributing to DRYML you agree to the [DRYML Individual Contributor License Agreement (DICLA)](DRYML%20Individual%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement.md). 

In order to show your agreement with the DICLA, you should include at the end of a commit message
the following line: `Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>`, using your real name.

This can be done using the [`-s`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) flag on the `git commit`.



## Support Channels

The official support channels, for both users and contributors, are:

- GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/dryml/dryml/issues)*

**Before opening a new issue or submitting a new pull request, it's helpful to*
*search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the*
*issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.*



## Propose a Feature

* Open an issue with a detailed description of your proposed feature, the motivation for it and alternatives considered. Please note we may close this issue or ask you to create a pull-request if this is not something we see as sufficiently high priority.
